to run this program you need to create a database i have a sql file in the flask folder.
flask run on the client side while mysql and java app runs on the backend.
to run the java app you need to build a jar file that can be execuate from the command line
you will use task schedular which will enable the the jar to be execuate at certain intervals let say 1 minute.
